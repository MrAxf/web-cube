import WebCube from "@components/web-cube.astro"

The Web Cube element has a few properties that you can use to customize the cube.

## size

You can change the size of the cube by setting the `size` property.

Has default value of `3`.

If size is set to `0`, below `0` or `NaN`, the size will be set to the default value.

```html title="index.html"
<web-cube size="4"></web-cube>
```

<div class="rounded-lg overflow-hidden bg-slate-300 dark:bg-slate-700 my-8">
    <WebCube size={4} />
</div>

## speed

You can change the speed of the cube for animations by setting the `speed` property.

The speed is in milliseconds and represents the time it takes for the cube to rotate 90 degrees.

Has default value of `500`.

If speed is set to `0`, below `0` or `NaN`, the speed will be set to the default value.

```html title="index.html"
<web-cube speed="5000"></web-cube>
```

<div class="rounded-lg overflow-hidden bg-slate-300 dark:bg-slate-700 my-8">
    <WebCube size={2} speed={5000} />
</div>

## disabled-pointer-events

You can disable pointer events on the cube by setting the `disable-pointer-events` property.

The pointer events will be disabled while this property is present and is not set to `false`.

```html title="index.html"
<web-cube disabled-pointer-events></web-cube>
```

<div class="rounded-lg overflow-hidden bg-slate-300 dark:bg-slate-700 my-8">
    <WebCube disabledPointerEvents size={2} />
</div>
