## State types

### `Face` Enum

The `Face` enum represents the faces of a cube. It includes the following values:

- `Face.Front`: Represents the front face of the cube. Has a value of `0`.
- `Face.Back`: Represents the back face of the cube. Has a value of `1`.
- `Face.Left`: Represents the left face of the cube. Has a value of `2`.
- `Face.Right`: Represents the right face of the cube. Has a value of `3`.
- `Face.Up`: Represents the top face of the cube. Has a value of `4`.
- `Face.Down`: Represents the bottom face of the cube. Has a value of `5`.

### `FlatState` Type

The `FlatState` type is an object that represents a flat representation of the state of a cube. It includes the following properties:

- `[Face.Up]`: A 2D array of [`Face`](#face-enum) values representing the top face of the cube.
- `[Face.Down]`: A 2D array of [`Face`](#face-enum) values representing the bottom face of the cube.
- `[Face.Left]`: A 2D array of [`Face`](#face-enum) values representing the left face of the cube.
- `[Face.Right]`: A 2D array of [`Face`](#face-enum) values representing the right face of the cube.
- `[Face.Front]`: A 2D array of [`Face`](#face-enum) values representing the front face of the cube.
- `[Face.Back]`: A 2D array of [`Face`](#face-enum) values representing the back face of the cube.

## Rotation options types

### `CubeRotationOptions` Type

The `CubeRotationOptions` type represents the options for rotating the entire cube. It includes the following properties:

- `axis`: The axis to rotate the cube. Must be `"x"`, `"y"`, or `"z"`.
- `angle`: The angle to rotate the cube. Must be `90`, `180`, `270`, or `360`.
- `backwards?`: Optional. Whether to rotate the cube backwards. Defaults to `false`.
- `speed?`: Optional. The speed of the rotation in milliseconds. Defaults to the instance speed.

### `LayerRotationOptions` Type

The `LayerRotationOptions` type represents the options for rotating a layer of the cube. It includes the following properties:

- `axis`: The axis of the layer to rotate. Must be `"x"`, `"y"`, or `"z"`.
- `layer`: The index of the layer to rotate. Must be between `0` and the size of the cube.
- `angle`: The angle to rotate the layer. Must be `90`, `180`, `270`, or `360`.
- `backwards?`: Optional. Whether to rotate the layer backwards. Defaults to `false`.
- `speed?`: Optional. The speed of the rotation in milliseconds. Defaults to the instance speed.

### `RotationOptions` Type

The `RotationOptions` type represents the options for rotating either the entire cube or a layer of the cube. It includes the following properties:

- `type`: The type of rotation. Must be `"cube"` or `"layer"`.
- `axis`: The axis to rotate the cube. Must be `"x"`, `"y"`, or `"z"`.
- `layer?`: Optional. The index of the layer to rotate. Must be between `0` and the size of the cube. Only required if `type` is `"layer"`.
- `angle`: The angle to rotate the cube. Must be `90`, `180`, `270`, or `360`.
- `backwards?`: Optional. Whether to rotate the cube backwards. Defaults to `false`.
- `speed?`: Optional. The speed of the rotation in milliseconds. Defaults to the instance speed.
